# 🔐 Voice Unlock AI – Terminal Style

Welcome to **Voice Unlock AI**, a terminal-based voice authentication system that unlocks access with your **secret spoken phrase**.

Inspired by high-tech security systems. This project allows you to unlock access using your voice in a **smooth, hacker-style terminal interface**, powered by real-time speech recognition and fuzzy phrase matching.

## 🛠️ Installation

- Install The Required Deps
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
- Run **unlock_ai.py**
   ```bash
   python unlock_ai.py
   ```


## 🚀 How It Works

1. Microphone is calibrated
2. User is prompted to speak the **secret phrase**
3. Voice is recognized and compared using fuzzy matching
4. If similarity > 0.8 → Access Granted ✅  
   Else → Access Denied ❌

Example secret phrase:
> `hello world`
